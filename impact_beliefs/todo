do payoff calculation
--> double check steapness/parametrization for belief elicitation  --> take the one with 50% deviation, then see in pilot how many people always pick 200
--> double check participation fee (if completed) (& set a lower part fee if filtered out in the beginning?)

Use currency function everywhere where necessary!
--> No, use float field, because currency rounds to integers when using points

Code Carbon Footprint calculator using radiobutton fields with labels of the verbal instructions & values equal to the CO2 values
make next pages button with Java script, such that the entire calculator is on one page.
instruct people to answer for their pre-pandemic behavior

elicit beliefs about impact of different pro-environmental behaviors


remember to track screen resolutions (& double check in chrome) & response times & errors in control questions (Hauke counter snippet)


include honey-pots in the program to check that no bots participated
