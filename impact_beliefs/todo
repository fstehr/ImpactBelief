think about how to control that people refresh the page in belief elicitation -> Check that refresh button/ F5 is disabled
--> otree timeout continues to run --> no benefit of doing so !! PUT IN INSTRUCTIONS
--> adjust payoff accordingly when there was a timeout

--> test payoff consequences properly

- fix timeout on trialsliders page (esp. passing on timeout counter to form!)

==> OBS!!  gif clicked value and equation clicked value are re-set to false when the page is re-loaded
        Do this in the reset tabs function using local storage
        Using the two lines of code from noel on how to get current value from html
        Value=get element by id(). Value
        Get element by id. Value = value

check why there is a time problem on instructions page [Violation] 'click' handler took 2274ms

--> Update informed consent form to be correct, esp. privacy part


Update matrix pictures - use different latex preamble (beamer document class with small margins)
then convert pdf into pngs
in parameter csv file - rename all image names to matrix_40_1.PNG (i.e. append .png everywhere)


## from trying all pages - layoutwise
- on beliefinstructions1 and donationinstruction1 nav arrows are further apart than on other instr pages
- right align otree btn
- on carbon belief and costbelief change spacing above next button



for carbon beliefs: fix form validation using = java eventlistener and only let people pass if they touched all sliders


## LAYOUT STUFF i.e. nice to have
