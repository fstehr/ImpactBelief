        Welcome to this experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        First, you are asked to work on a real-effort task. For completing the task you will earn {{ Constants.endowment }} ECU.
        1 ECU is equivalent to &pound;0.01.

    <strong>We apply the following procedure:</strong>&nbsp;

        <ol>
         <li>For each task we calculate the error you made. This is how many percentage points your report was away from the true answer.</li>
         <li>We square the error.&nbsp;</li>
         <li>We calculate your accuracy: We subtract the squared error&nbsp;from 100%.&nbsp;</li>
         <li>We find the reward to this task: We&nbsp;multiply by 5.</li>
         <li>Then, we randomly pick one of the tasks, your bonus will be equal to the&nbsp;reward for this task.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> Suppose that <strong>you report 80%&nbsp;that a <span style="color:#ff0000;">RED BOX</span></strong> was picked in Step 1. Then, your rewards are as follows:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>If the <span style="color:#ff0000;">BOX</span> was indeed <span style="color:#ff0000;">RED</span></strong>:</li>
        </ul>

         <ul>
          <li>your error&nbsp;is (100%-80%)=20%,</li>
          <li>your squared error&nbsp;is (20%)*(20%)=4%</li>
          <li>your accuracy is 100%-4%=96%</li>
             <li>your reward </li>
        </ul>
