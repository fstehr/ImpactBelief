                            Welcome to this experiment, which is run by Frauke Stehr, a researcher from Maastricht University.
                            In the experiment, you will be able to earn money based on the choices you make during the experiment.
                            In particular, you will earn a fixed fee of {{ session.config.participation_fee }} for the completion
                            of the study. You can earn substantially more, depending on your answers in the experiment.
                            We calibrated the payments, such that participants will earn on average &pound 3.15,
                            however it can be more or less, depending on your answers during the experiment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Upon your request and expression of consent, we collect answers to the experiment you provide.
                            From the collection of these data no individual can be personally identified.
                            The data are anonymous, with the exception of your Prolific ID, which is needed to administer payments.
                            The researcher will not have access to any other personal information and thus the researcher cannot
                            link this ID to any other personal data. After the payment has been handled, we will delete the Prolific IDs from the data set and anonymize it.
                            It will not be possible to identify participants based on their answers.
                            The data collected in this experiment will be used for
                            academic research in behavioural economics. We will publish the findings in scientific papers.
                            These papers will contain only anonymous, aggregated data (e.g. percentages and averages) presented
                            as tables and figures. They will not contain any data on individual responses.

                        <p>
                            The study uses the cloud services provided by Heroku to store and process the data. To send emails to you,
                            the study uses the services provided by Academic Prolific. These companies declare to be compliant with GDPR.
                            Other than your Prolific ID, no other data are shared with these companies. Your Prolific ID is stored encrypted
                            in the Heroku cloud database and cannot be read by anyone outside the research team. All anonymized raw data
                            collected in the experiments will be safely stored on servers at Maastricht University. Maastricht University
                            stores all data for at least 10 years. Thereafter, data are destroyed or transferred to other media for longer
                            storage if necessary.

                            The study uses the app oTree which is hosted on the servers provided by Heroku, a cloud platform based in the
